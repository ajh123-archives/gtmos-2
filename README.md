# GTMOS
### A hobby operating system based of [duckOS](https://github.com/byteduck/duckOS/)

A hobby UNIX-like OS with a graphical window manager for x86 computers.
The business version of [duckOS](https://github.com/byteduck/duckOS/)?

### Try our parent OS, duckOS, in your browser!
Thanks to the [v86 project](https://github.com/copy/v86) by [copy](https://copy.sh), you can now try a (slow) version of duckOS in your browser! [Try it here!](https://aaron.sonin.me/duckOS)

### What's working
- Booting off of the primary master IDE (PATA) hard drive on both emulators and real hardware (tested on a Dell Optiplex 320 with a Pentium D)
- PATA DMA or PIO access (force PIO by using the `use_pio` grub kernel argument)
- A virtual filesystem with device files (`/dev/hda`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/random`, `/dev/fb`, `/dev/tty`, etc)
  - The root filesystem is ext2, and is writeable
- Disk caching
- Dynamic linking with shared libraries
- A Bochs/Qemu/VirtualBox/Multiboot video driver (640x480x32bpp)
- A window manager / compositor called pond
- Various GUI applications
- Ports of binutils and gcc
- More!

### Future plans
#### Stuff that may happen soonâ„¢.
- ~~Revamp virtual memory system so it's not as error-prone and easier to debug (named regions, fix race conditions, faster allocation, etc.)~~ **Done!**
- Revamp kernel IPC system to be more efficient (Replace SocketFS with something like Mach or MINIX's grant-based IPC)
- Better font rendering (Vector fonts, different sizes, etc.)
- ~~Finish porting GCC~~, self-host
- More s t a b i l i t y and s p e e d
- A better filesystem cache implementation that can free memory when needed and periodically flushes writes
- More kernel & userspace unit tests
- Better documentation of kernel, libraries, and applications
- Some more kernel & userspace debugging tools so I don't have to spend hours knee-deep in the qemu debugger whenever a segfault happens due to a simple bug that could've been avoided with some extra coffee in my system

### Lofty goals
#### Maybe someday.
- Multiprocessor (multicore) support
- x64 / ARM support (?)
- Slowly transition various modules from the kernel to userspace (ie microkernel)
- Add Rust into the mix (?)
- Network support
 
### Services

The code for these can be found in [services](services/).

- Init (/bin/init): The init system for duckOS.
- Pond (/bin/pond): The window manager / compositor for duckOS.
- Quack (/bin/quack): The sound server for duckOS.

### GUI Programs

The code for these can be found in [programs](/programs)

- Terminal (/apps/terminal.app): A libui-based terminal application.
- System Monitor (/apps/monitor.app): A basic system monitor showing memory and CPU utilization.
- 4 In a Row (/apps/4inarow.app): A basic four-in-a-row game. Play with two players or against the computer.

- Files (/apps/files.app): A rudimentary file explorer application.
- Viewer (apps/viewer.app): A basic image viewer.
 
### CLI Programs

The code for these can be found in [programs](programs/).

- ls (/bin/ls): Lists the entries in the current or given directory.
- cat (/bin/cat): Writes the contents of a file to stdout.
- cp (/bin/cp): Copies a file.
- mv (/bin/mv): Moves a file.
- pwd (/bin/pwd): Prints the current working directory.
- mkdir (/bin/mkdir): Creates a new directory.
- echo (/bin/echo): Prints the arguments given to it separated by spaces to stdout.
- rm (/bin/rm): Removes a file.
- ln (/bin/ln): Creates a hard or symbolic link to a file or directory.
- rmdir (/bin/rmdir): Removes a directory.
- touch (/bin/touch): Updates the access/modification times of a file or creates it if it doesn't exist.

- chmod (/bin/chmod): Changes the mode of a file.
- chown (/bin/chown): Changes the owner of a file.
- free (/bin/free): Shows the amount of total, used, and free memory (use the -h flag for human-readable numbers).
- ps (/bin/ps): Shows the currently running processes.

  - There is only support for one redirection at a time right now.
- open (/bin/open): A utility to open files and applications from the command line.
- play (/bin/play): Plays audio files.

Programs that take arguments will provide you with the correct usage when you run them without arguments.


### Libraries
